        My research interests center around compact astrophysical objects, particularly 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star">neutron stars</a>, 
        and using them to understand physics in extreme environments. These research activities 
        are currently separated into three major areas:

    <h3>Fundamental Physics with Pulsar-Binary/Triple systems</h3>
    <p align="left">
        Radio pulsars are renowned for being useful in probing all kinds of 
        phenomena by timing their pulses. I use pulsars in all kinds of orbits to study orbital dynamics 
        with high timing precision. By properly characterizing gravitational effects, we can ultimately 
        derive intrinsic properties of the systems in question, such as the neutron-star mass, 
        which yields high-impact constraints on possible nuclear processes within their interiors that 
        remain theoretically elusive. For a short review on this topic, feel free to check out 
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08194.pdf"> our contribution</a> for the Astro2020 U. S. 
        Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics.

    <h3>Pulsar and FRB Science with CHIME</h3>
    <p align="left">
        Since November 2016, I helped build and commission two "backend" instruments for the telescope 
        built in support of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment 
        (<a href="https://chime-experiment.ca">CHIME</a>). This work, a wonderful and lively mix of hardware 
        and software development, aims to enable CHIME for timing observations of Northern-hemisphere pulsars, 
        and blind searches of "fast radio bursts" (FRBs). FRBs represent a new and emerging phenomenon 
        whose origin remains a complete mystery. While they are extremely hard to detect, the properties 
        of the CHIME telescope (a telescope that constantly acquires data of a large patch of sky at any 
        instant in time) make it superior for catching FRBs.

    <h3>Detecting and Characterizing Gravitational Waves with Pulsars</h3>

    <p align="left">
        Given their clock-like nature, radio pulsars are also useful for detecting gravitational waves. 
        We are using an ensemble of millisecond pulsars (i.e., pulsars that spin with periods on the order 
        of milliseconds) to detect gravitational waves from distant, supermassive black hole binary systems. 
        This project, the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves 
        (<a href="http://nanograv.org">NANOGrav</a>), uses the 300-m Arecibo Observatory, 100-m Green Bank 
        Telescope, and CHIME to make high-precision measurements for detecting gravitational waves within 
        the next 5 years.
