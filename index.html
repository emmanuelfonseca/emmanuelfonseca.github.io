        Hello / hola / salut! I currently work as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Physics 
        at McGill University, 
        and as part of the <a href="https://msi.mcgill.ca">McGill Space Institute</a>. I will be joining the 
        Department of Physics and Astronomy at <a href="https://physics.wvu.edu">West Virginia University</a> 
        (WVU) in Fall 2021 as an assistant professor.

        My area of research is radio-transient astronomy, with particular focus on radio pulsars and fast 
        radio bursts. I am a proud member of the radio-astronomy group led by Dr. Victoria Kaspi, and was 
        previously a part of of the group led by Dr. Ingrid Stairs during my graduate studies.
    </p>
