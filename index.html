        Hello / hola / salut! I work as a radio astronomer, using and building radio telescopes to observe to 
        most extreme objects and environments in the Universe. I will be joining the 
        Department of Physics and Astronomy at <a href="https://physics.wvu.edu">West Virginia University</a> 
        (WVU) in Fall 2021 as an assistant professor. 
    </p>

        My specific area of research is radio-transient astronomy, with particular focus on radio pulsars and fast 
        radio bursts. Before WVU, I was a proud member of the radio-astronomy group led by Dr. Victoria Kaspi as 
        a postdoctoral researcher, and the group led by Dr. Ingrid Stairs during my graduate studies.
