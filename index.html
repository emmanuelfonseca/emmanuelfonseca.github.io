    <p align="left"> Hello / hola / salut!</p>
    <p align="left">
        I currently work as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Physics at McGill University, 
        and part of the <a href="https://msi.mcgill.ca">McGill Space Institute</a>. My area of research is 
        radio-transient astronomy, with particular focus on radio pulsars and fast radio bursts. I am a 
        proud member of the radio-astronomy group led by Dr. Victoria Kaspi, and was previously a part of 
        of the group led by Dr. Ingrid Stairs during my graduate studies.
